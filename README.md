# Frontend

This week will be centered on building a full web application and deploying it on digital ocean. 

It is intended as an exercise which will bring the previous three weeks together.

But a few new things will be thrown in along the way:

* Since we will be deploying in the cloud, the app should be usable from both a laptop and from a mobile phone. For that we will take a look at **bootstrap**.
* We will try some simple tricks in **javascript and HTML5** to make the userinterface just a nicer
* The web-app should be deployed on digital ocean. The source code however should be handed-in by putting it on **github**.

# Readings

## Bootstrap
* If you are a "I need to try it out" person, then the tutorials on [w3schools has a good bootstap tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp)
* Lynda.com has a series of video courses on how to use bootstrap. The one I would recommend is [Bootstrap 3 Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Bootstrap-tutorials/Welcome/417641/429420-4.html)

>Pitfall: Several of the online tutorials talk about how to download bootstrap. **You should not download bootstrap** but just use the method they call CDN - linking to a **C**ontents **D**elivery **N**etwork.
