# Frontend

This week will be centered on building a full web application and deploying it on digital ocean. 

It is intended as an exercise which will bring the previous three weeks together.

But a few new things will be thrown in along the way:

* Since we will be deploying in the cloud, the app should be usable from both a laptop and from a mobile phone. For that we will take a look at **bootstrap**.
* We will try some simple tricks in **javascript and HTML5** to make the userinterface just a nicer
* The web-app should be deployed on digital ocean. The source code however should be handed-in by putting it on **github**.
